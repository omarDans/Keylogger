# Keylogger
Simple Hand-made keylogger

Just a simple keylogger in C++ i did for fun and practice. It has a lot of flaws and a lot of things to implement to get a "reliable performance" but has the essence and i had a lot of fun doing it :)

*I am not responsible for any misuse of the program, this program was created for educational purposes only*

I know noone is going to actually use it but i always wanted to write that ;)
